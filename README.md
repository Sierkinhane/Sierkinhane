### Hi there, I'm Jinheng Xie. 👋

- 🌱 I'm Jinheng Xie, a PhD student at National University of Singapore, working with Professor [Mike Shou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h1-3lSoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). </a>
- ❤️  My research interests focus on computer vision. Specifically, I was enthusiastically working on **label-efficient learning of scene understanding (object localization and segmentation in un/weakly-supervised manners)**. Currently, I'm working on exploring **multi-modal pre-training and generation** like generative pre-training and text-to-image generation.
- ❤️  I'm currently serving as a reviewer for **TPAMI** (IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence), **IJCV** (International Journal of Computer Vision), AAAI and CVPR.
